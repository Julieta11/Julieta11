### hi! how are you? :cherry_blossom:

My name is Julieta (she/her). I'm a backend software engineer with experience in a diverse set of languages and tools. Recently, the ones I enjoy the most are Golang and Python.

I look for jobs about which Iâ€™m passionate because this allows me to be significantly productive and creative :rocket:.

I'm extremely eager about intersectional feminism, climate change and international human rights. When I'm not working or engaged with some personal project, I'll be reading, doodling, or trying to learn a new language.
