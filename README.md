### hi! how are you? üåà :cherry_blossom:

I'm Juli (she/her). I'm a backend software engineer with experience in a diverse set of languages and tools based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I look for jobs about which I‚Äôm passionate because this allows me to be significantly creative.

I'm extremely eager about about intersectional feminism and art. When I'm not working, I'll be reading, doodling, collaging or trying to learn a new language.

Here's a collection of books that I absolutely love:

- **Tengo miedo torero** by Pedro Lemebel
- **La raz√≥n est√©tica** by Chantal Maillard
- **Le mythe de sisyphe** by Albert Camus
- **Historias de cronopios y de famas** by Julio Cort√°zar
- **Las malas** by Camilla Sosa Villada
- **Obsesi√≥n de vivir** by Jos√© Sbarra

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any of them or if you have any recommendations of your own!
